Backlight notification for Samsung Nexus S (i9020 only!)

Kernel distributors / developers:
Please make sure that you inform your users that this works currently only with the i9020.

The i9023 has difference(s) that we (morfic and me) have not yet discovered.
Support for the i9023 may be added, as soon as we have found the difference(s).

Liblights:
And you need to replace the stock liblights by a modified liblights.
You can find source code and prebuild binaries at "https://github.com/neldar/backlightnotification".

For the nexus you can also use the same liblights binary as for the galaxy s.
